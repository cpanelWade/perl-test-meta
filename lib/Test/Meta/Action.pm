=head1 NAME

Test::Meta - Explictly describe your tests and automatically act on said description


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::Meta version 0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Meta (
        'POD' => 1,
        'Memory' => 1
    );

…

    # SKIP POD tests are only run under RELEASE_TESTING.
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Using this module a developer can describe (L<Test::Meta::Desc>) his tests.

At runtime the description helps define a set of rules (L<Test::Meta::Rule>) to act on.

For example, in the SYNOPSIS example the POD rule enabled the RELEASE_TESTING Rule.

=head1 INTERFACE 

This is a super basic and inflexible–logic list that highlights the idea.

The value of each given rule is passed to the rule or rules it triggers so it can act accordingly.
